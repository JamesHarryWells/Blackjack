# Blackjack
This is my first Javascript attempt at Blackjack. I am currently looking to develop this into a more complex design using CSS to create actual playing cards for the hands whilst also making the text a bit clearer and a nicer layout. If anybody would like to advise me on the best way of doing that I am open to any suggestions.
